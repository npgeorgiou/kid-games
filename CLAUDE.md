Library of independent HTML5 touchscreen games with Greek settings, for a Windows touchscreen PC. Primary player: a highly capable, curious four-year-old. Games first: real systems, strategy, physics and decisions, never preschool worksheets.

Authoritative brief: `docs/brief.txt` (full catalogue of 40 games, design principles, GDD requirements). Read only the section a task needs, by line range:

| Lines | Section |
|---|---|
| 10-60 | 1. Project brief (setting, authenticity, language, platform) |
| 61-98 | 2. What every game design must specify |
| 99-130 | 3. Global design principles |
| 131-1311 | 4. Ranked catalogue; find a game with `grep -n "^<N>\. " docs/brief.txt` |
| 1312-1345 | 5. Overlaps: how similar games stay distinct |
| 1346-1421 | 6. Development order, GDD contents, shared library, tech foundation |
| 1422-1458 | 7. Instructions for design work |

## Working rules

- Be mindful of token economy. Read only the sections a task needs, never whole files.
- If a message asks a question, answer it and wait before coding.
- Never invent rules, stats or mechanics. Unknown or unverified details are stated as unknown. Research historical details; do not guess them.
- Change only what was asked. Fix bugs generically, not just the example mentioned.
- Answers: short plain prose, no recap, no offers, no command output. English only.
- After every change: push, and give only the changed HTML files as downloads.
- When a chat gets long, say so and give a short handoff.

## Product rules

- All player-facing text in natural, correct Modern Greek. Design docs and code comments in English.
- Never require reading or spoken instructions: short labels, clear icons, visual demonstration. Not babyish.
- Touch and mouse are both first-class (development happens on a PC without a touchscreen): Pointer Events, large targets, no hover, no tiny controls, no required keyboard, no multi-touch-only gestures.
- No numerals for gameplay quantities; see Quantities below.
- Real-time games must offer pause-and-plan or turn-based play.
- Level unlocks always have a parent override that opens any level.
- One coherent Greek period and region per game or campaign; do not mix eras.
- Conflict is abstract and non-graphic. No frightening imagery, ads, monetization, streaks or punitive timers.
- Failure is informative, retry is immediate, unrelated progress is never erased.
- Introduce one new rule at a time; difficulty comes from combining known rules, not from unfair controls.
- The owner supplies voice and sound files; code provides hooks for them.

## Quantities without numbers

Any game with amounts, prices, capacities or strengths shows them as things the player can see and compare, not as digits:

- Countable objects: coins, sacks, soldiers, amphorae drawn individually, kept small enough to take in at a glance and grouped when larger.
- Size for magnitude: small and big coins, small and big loads.
- Slots for capacity: a donkey has visible saddlebag places; a full one has no empty place.
- Fill levels for continuous amounts: water, time, stamina, progress.
- Comparison by placing things side by side or pairing them off, so "more" is seen, not calculated.
- Change shown as objects moving: coins leave the purse and goods arrive.

Exact representations per game are set in its GDD. A numeral may appear only as a secondary label.

## Period coverage

The brief's period list also includes the Greco-Italian War of 1940-1941 (Women of Pindus). These settings replace the brief's, so that 1821 and the Balkan Wars are covered. Mechanics are unchanged; all historical details are researched at GDD time, not assumed.

| Game | Setting |
|---|---|
| 11. Castle Defense | War of Independence, 1821: defending a mountain pass or fortified position |
| 13. Island Conquest | War of Independence, 1821: the island fleets in the Aegean |
| 39. Treasure Hunt | First scenario: 1821-era historic house |
| 10. Cargo Train Routing | Balkan Wars, 1912-1913: supply railway |
| 6. Bridge Builder | Second campaign: Balkan Wars, 1912-1913, army engineers |
| 7. Little Fighters | Open; not tied to a historical sport (for example an all-heroes roster). Decided in its GDD |

Kept as written in the brief: Lost Mine (Byzantine mine with carts on rails) and Women of Pindus content. Siege Engineer: check which throwing machines fit which period before use.

## Tech

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Canvas for game scenes, physics, animation; DOM for menus and UI.
- LocalStorage or IndexedDB for progress and settings; Web Audio API; fullscreen support.
- No backend. Runs locally on the PC.
- Each game independently playable and testable, launched from one library page.

## Process

These override the brief where they differ.

- Per game: one-page design, then a rough prototype of the core mechanic, tested with the child, then the full GDD at `docs/gdd/<game>.md` covering the list in brief lines 1367-1385, then the full build.
- Build one game to a genuinely playable standard before starting others. Shared code is extracted from finished games, not built in advance.
- First game: Tower Builder.
- Priority after it: Waterworks, Mechanical Workshop, Siege Engineer, Cargo Train Routing and Robot Programming move up; the trade and conquest games (Donkey Caravan Trader, Merchant Shipping, Castle Conquest, Island Conquest) move down.
- Games that need on-screen run and jump buttons (Women of Pindus, Adventure Platformer, Beat-'em-up, Little Fighters) get a control prototype before any commitment.
- Tiers C and D are a backlog, not a commitment. Nothing is discarded.

## Status

- Repo initialised with this file and the brief. No design, no code yet.
- Next: Tower Builder one-page design.

## Decided

- File layout: one self-contained HTML file per game (opens by double-click) plus a library page linking to them. Shared code lives once in the repo and a build script copies it into each game file. Sounds play through audio elements or are embedded. Test saved progress on the target PC early.
- Physics: an existing library embedded in the game file. First choice Planck.js, fallback Matter.js; the Tower Builder prototype is the stack test. Confirm the licence before embedding. Bridge Builder decided later.
